I served as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate foundational design courses, supporting the development of students’ design thinking and spatial perception skills through studio-based activities and iterative critique. Working closely with external instructors, I helped streamline teaching workflows, ensure consistent delivery of course materials, and facilitate smoother coordination across sessions. I also managed day-to-day teaching logistics, including scheduling tutorials and reviews, coordinating communication between students and instructors, and aligning teaching arrangements to maintain an efficient and well-organized learning environment.
